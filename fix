## 1. Syntax Error in cache-redis.ts
Location: project-doc/project-code/src/lib/cache-redis.ts line 55
Problem: Orphaned code blocks outside of function context
- There's an if (value === null) block that appears to be floating outside any function
- The parser expects a comma but finds === because the code structure is malformed
- There are duplicate/orphaned code blocks mixed into the middle of the file

## 2. Missing AWS SDK Dependency
Location: project-doc/project-code/src/lib/aws/s3-service.ts line 16
Problem: Missing package dependency
- Code imports getSignedUrl from @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
- This package is not installed in package.json
- Need to add: "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner": "^3.958.0"

## 3. Potential Client-Side AWS SDK Usage (from conversation history)
Context: Previous builds failed due to AWS SDK being used in client components
Problem: AWS SDK imports cannot be used in Next.js client components
- Must be server-side only or in API routes
- Causes http2 module resolution errors in browser environment

## Summary
The immediate blockers are:
1. Critical: Fix malformed code structure in cache-redis.ts
2. Critical: Add missing @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner dependency
3. Review: Ensure no AWS SDK usage in client components (based on previous failures)
