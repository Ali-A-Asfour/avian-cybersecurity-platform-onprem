# AWS ProServe Delivery Framework - Implementation Guidance

## Overview

This steering document establishes the foundational framework for delivering quality implementation plans based on AWS Professional Services' proven methodologies. Our delivery approach follows the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and Day 1 Delivery (D1D) principles to ensure consistent, bar-raising customer experiences.

## Core Delivery Philosophy

### What is Delivery?
Delivery is what we sell and provide as Professional Services. We follow the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF), a shared mental model for cloud transformation that leverages AWS experience and best practices to enable customers to:
- Identify and prioritize transformation opportunities
- Evaluate and improve cloud readiness  
- Iteratively evolve transformation roadmaps

### Key Customer Business Outcomes (CBOs)
All implementations must target these core customer business outcomes:
- **Reduced Business Risk**: Enhanced security, compliance, and operational resilience
- **Improved ESG Performance**: Environmental, social, and governance improvements
- **Increased Revenue**: New revenue streams and market opportunities
- **Operational Efficiency**: Cost optimization and process improvements

### Day 1 Delivery (D1D) Mindset
We maintain a Day 1 mindset that is:
- **Curious**: Always learning and questioning assumptions
- **Inventive**: Creative problem-solving and innovation
- **Scrappy**: Resourceful and efficient execution
- **Fast**: Rapid delivery without compromising quality

## #OneTeam Approach

### Core Principle
This isn't a delivery, technical, or sales-only process – we all take ownership in the customer experience and journey as #OneTeam.

### Team Roles and Responsibilities

| Persona | Associated Roles | Description |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **ProServe Sales** | PM, CPM, ESM, CDA, APM | At the table with Sales Team during customer scoping and sales motion (Stakeholder) |
| **ProServe Delivery** | EM, Engagement Lead, Consultants | Runs delivery from kickoff to close on behalf of customer and partner |
| **Managers** | DPM, Sr PM, Area Lead | People managers with decision-making authority for their teams |
| **Leadership** | VP, Director | People managers with decision-making authority for the organization |

### #OneTeam Meeting Requirements
Critical touchpoints that facilitate seamless collaboration across:
- AWS Sales Team (Account Manager, TAM, SA, CSM)
- ProServe Sales Team
- Delivery Team
- Internal Partners (if applicable)

**Objectives:**
- Create unified platform for early and frequent collaboration
- Align expectations, resources, and strategies
- Identify and address potential roadblocks
- Support flawless delivery that exceeds customer expectations

## Global Delivery Framework (GDF) Components

### 1. Worldwide (WW) Standards
The delivery bar has been defined through WW Standards that ensure consistent, high-quality delivery across all engagements.

### 2. Worldwide (WW) Guidance
Each standard has supporting guidance that helps teams meet or exceed the standard. This serves as leading practice and suggested implementation methodology.

### 3. ProServe Delivery Practices (PDP)
- Single, searchable destination for delivery best practices
- Each GDF process has playbooks, runbooks, practice considerations, and FAQs
- Adheres to ProServe tenet: "Build Once, Use Often, Improve Always"

## Implementation Quality Requirements

### Security-First Approach
Regardless of what we sell, how we deliver should prioritize security:
- Pre-Engagement Security Assessment (PESA) required for all SOWs
- Security considerations integrated throughout delivery lifecycle
- Proper resource allocation for security controls
- Contract considerations for secure engagement

### Customer Business Outcomes Focus
Every implementation must:
- Define measurable customer business outcomes
- Articulate impact of deliverables
- Utilize CBO playbook guidance
- Position AWS as trusted advisor
- Enhance credibility through outcome delivery

### Consistent Experience Standards
- Bar-raising delivery quality
- Consistent customer experience across all touchpoints
- Proactive risk management and mitigation
- Clear communication and stakeholder alignment
- Continuous improvement and learning

## Quality Assurance Mechanisms

### Opportunity Quality Review (OQR)
- Completed during technical validation stage
- Strengthens business case in proposals
- Inspects likelihood of successful delivery
- Supports sales and delivery team efforts

### Delivery Quality Inspection (DQI)
- Self-inspection for long-running teams
- Sanity check delivery governance processes
- Beneficial for teams 120-365 days after project start
- Expedites back-to-green planning for Red/Amber engagements

### Metrics and Reporting
- Panorama dashboard for comprehensive reporting
- Adoption tracking as ProServe annual goal
- Transparency and ownership principles
- Regular business reviews and goal tracking

## Success Metrics

### Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)

- Survey sent at end of all engagements where legally possible
- Measures satisfaction with products and services

### Deliverable Acceptance

- Monitor and update progress throughout project
- Validate customer expectations are met
- Ensure compliance with contractual obligations

### Continuous Improvement
