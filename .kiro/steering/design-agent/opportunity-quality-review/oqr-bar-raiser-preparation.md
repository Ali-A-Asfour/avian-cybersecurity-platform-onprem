# OQR 2.0 Bar Raiser Inspection Preparation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive preparation instructions for OQR bar raiser inspections when high-risk patterns are identified. Follow this framework to ensure successful inspection outcomes and quality delivery assurance.

## When Bar Raiser Inspection is Required

### Automatic Triggers
Bar raiser inspection is mandatory when ANY of these conditions exist:

#### Financial Risk Thresholds
- **Large Deal Size**: Total Contract Value (TCV) + Additional Investment (AI) > $5M USD
- **High-Value Fixed Price**: Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts > $500K USD  
- **Insufficient Risk Premium**: FFP contracts with risk premium < 15% of total value

#### Technical Risk Factors
- **Production Environment Access**: Any level of customer production access required
- **Regulated Data Handling**: PII, PHI, CUI, financial data, or compliance-regulated information
- **Insufficient Security Staffing**: Security resource roles < 8% of total project effort
- **AI/ML Without Approval**: AI/ML services without completed Responsible AI Reviews (RAIR)

#### Partnership Risk Indicators
- **Thin Prime Structure**: Partner delivery > 50% of total project hours
- **Unclear Partner Responsibilities**: Ambiguous work distribution or deliverable ownership
- **Multiple Partner Complexity**: More than one partner firm involved

#### Delivery Risk Patterns
- **AI Training Data Conflicts**: Custom AI/ML training without regulated data access alignment
- **Production Access Misalignment**: Production access needs without corresponding contract terms
- **Top 20th Percentile Risk Score**: Automated risk scoring in highest risk category
