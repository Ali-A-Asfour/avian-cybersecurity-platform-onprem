Connection Details:
-------------------
Source IP: 203.0.113.78 (External)
Source Country: Unknown

Action Taken:
-------------
- Scan detected and logged
- No services exposed on scanned ports
- Source IP monitored for additional activity
- Rate limiting applied to source

Analysis:
---------
This appears to be an automated port scan, likely from a bot or
scanning tool. No services were exposed, and no vulnerabilities
were exploited. This is routine internet background noise.

Risk Assessment:
----------------
Risk Level: LOW
Impact: None (no services exposed)
Likelihood of Attack: Low
Recommended Action: Monitor only

Recommendations:
----------------
1. Continue monitoring for repeated scans
2. Verify no unnecessary services are exposed
3. Ensure firewall rules are properly configured
4. Consider geo-blocking if scans persist
5. Review WAN access policies
