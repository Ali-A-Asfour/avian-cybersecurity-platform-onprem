# Design Agent Workflow - Requirements

## Purpose

Transform project documents into implementation-ready specification packages through a systematic, quality-driven workflow that ensures enterprise-grade standards and comprehensive security assessment.

## Business Problem

Traditional specification development suffers from:
- **Incomplete Requirements**: Teams proceed with poorly structured requirements, causing implementation delays
- **Poor Design Quality**: Specifications lack depth, contain inconsistencies, fail enterprise standards  
- **Security Gaps**: Security considerations added as afterthought, leading to vulnerabilities
- **Quality Inconsistency**: No systematic approach to ensure implementation readiness

## Solution Approach

### Orchestrated Workflow with Modular Architecture

The workflow transforms project documents into enterprise-grade specification packages through systematic progression from context capture to final delivery:

**Stage 0: Session Management**
- Execution mode detection (new session, continuation, recovery)
- Customer context capture (project goals, technical preferences, organizational context)
- Workflow state initialization and context source establishment
- Handoff protocols for seamless workflow progression

**Stage 1: Project Analysis**
- Assess project complexity and provide workflow recommendations
- Analyze document count, size, and types to determine execution strategy
- Provide time estimates and session management guidance
- Document project characteristics for context-aware execution

**Stage 2: Requirements Generation**
- Conduct comprehensive three-category input assessment analysis across project-context, technical-knowledge, and organization-context folders
- Extract integration requirements from external reference materials without misinterpreting them as build targets
- Apply organizational policies and standards as architectural constraints
- Transform project-specific context into structured requirements packages based purely on business needs
- Generate functional/non-functional requirements with category-specific traceability matrix
- Establish foundation for architecture design with clear separation of concerns
- Maintain requirements purity without influence from existing code patterns

**Stage 3: Architecture Generation**
- **Dual-Path Approach**: Intelligence Hub integration (Path A) or Standard generation (Path B)
- **Path A**: Expert-guided architecture with deep research option (15 min standard / 60 min deep)
- **Path B**: Systematic generation with reference architecture analysis and context-aware modes
- **Reference System Integration**: Incorporate project-code analysis from Stage 1 to inform architecture decisions
- Document architecture decisions with rationale and alternatives
- Balance requirements-driven design with existing system integration opportunities
- Comprehensive architecture integration validation with service limits assessment

**Stage 4: Holistic Quality Assessment**
- Multi-dimensional quality assessment across all domains (requirements + architecture together)
- Numerical scoring (0-100) with mandatory 90/100 threshold
- Iterative refinement optimizing requirements and architecture holistically
- Complete audit trail with score sheets for each iteration

**Stage 5: Security Assessment**
- AWS-compliant security threat modeling using STRIDE methodology
- Comprehensive security controls mapping and mitigation strategies
- Integration with specification package for complete security posture
- Security testing framework with concrete test cases

**Stage 6: Documentation Generation**
- Tools prescriptive guidance generation with comprehensive MCP servers and Skills inventory
- Project-specific MCP and Skills recommendations with implementation guidance
- Executive summary creation synthesizing final specification package
- Stakeholder communication materials and implementation readiness assessment

**Stage 7: Output Organization**
- Project folder structure validation and organization
- Iterative content management with proper file naming
- Specialized content organization (threat model, supplement material, executive summary)
- Final handoff preparation with comprehensive documentation

## Key Capabilities

### Organized Output Management
- **Single Project Folder**: All deliverables organized in one project folder with structured layout
- **Iteration Management**: Sequential specification packages (iteration-1, iteration-2, etc.)
- **Score Sheet Organization**: All assessment score sheets in project root with clear numbering
- **Threat Model Integration**: Dedicated folder for comprehensive security assessment
- **Supporting Documentation**: Organized supplement material including input assessment analysis

### Enhanced Input Assessment Analysis
- **Three-Category Requirements Processing**: Systematic analysis across three distinct requirements categories (project-context, technical-knowledge, organization-context)
- **Context Classification**: Automatic distinction between "what we're building" vs "what we're integrating with" vs "organizational constraints"
- **Technical Knowledge Integration**: Analysis of external reference materials to extract integration requirements without misinterpreting them as build targets
- **Organizational Policy Application**: Automatic application of company standards, naming conventions, and compliance requirements across all architecture decisions
- **Project Context Extraction**: Business, technical, and user context extraction from project-specific materials
- **Gap Identification**: Category-specific identification of missing information and constraints
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Complete stakeholder analysis with requirements categorization across requirements input types
- **Generation Readiness**: Requirements assessment of readiness to proceed with specification generation
- **Reference System Separation**: Legacy system analysis handled separately in Stage 1 to avoid biasing requirements

### Quality Assurance
- **Systematic Assessment**: Multi-dimensional evaluation across 5 quality categories
- **Numerical Scoring**: 0-100 scale with detailed feedback and improvement recommendations
- **Mandatory Threshold**: 90/100 minimum score before implementation readiness
- **Progress Tracking**: Transparent iteration management with score progression

### Security Integration
- **STRIDE-based Analysis**: Systematic threat identification across all categories
- **AWS Standards Compliance**: Baseline Security Controls (BSC) mapping
- **Actionable Mitigations**: Specific security controls with implementation guidance
- **Testing Framework**: Concrete security test cases and validation procedures

### Implementation Readiness
- **Complete Documentation**: All specification components present and validated
- **Traceability**: Requirements linked to business objectives and source documents
- **Development Support**: User stories with acceptance criteria and implementation guidance
- **Quality Validation**: Stakeholder confirmation and development team approval

### Dual-Path Architecture Generation
- **Path A - Intelligence Hub Integration**: Expert-guided architecture with optional deep research
  - Deep research decision: Standard (15 min) vs Deep (60 min) analysis
  - Complete JSON response preservation for audit trail
  - Expert insights and asset rankings integration
- **Path B - Standard Architecture Generation**: Systematic generation when Intelligence Hub unavailable
  - Architecture guidance selection framework application
  - Reference architecture download and gap analysis
  - Context-aware modes (POC/Production/Compliance/Budget)
  - Integration design with customization planning
- **Path Convergence**: Both paths converge to common architecture activities
- **Architecture Integration Validation**: Comprehensive validation with service limits assessment

### Enhanced Project Input System
- **Stage-Separated Input Processing**: Requirements generation uses three categories; architecture generation incorporates reference system analysis
- **Integration Requirements Extraction**: Analyze external API documentation and system references to derive integration constraints without treating them as build targets
- **Policy-Driven Architecture**: Automatic application of organizational standards, AWS resource tagging, security policies, and compliance requirements
- **Reference System Integration**: Systematic analysis of existing codebases in Stage 1, incorporated into architecture decisions in Stage 3
- **Context Separation**: Clear distinction between project requirements, external integration needs, organizational constraints, and reference system considerations
- **Traceability by Category**: Requirements traced to specific input categories; architecture decisions traced to requirements plus reference analysis
- **Category-Specific Quality Assessment**: Validation of specifications against requirements categories with detailed compliance reporting
