# Stage 4: Holistic Quality Assessment

## Overview

**Objective**: Achieve 90/100 quality score through systematic holistic improvement
**Dependencies**: 
- Architecture generation marked as complete in `.workflow-state/design-handoff.md`
- `core-methodology/design-review.md` (comprehensive methodology reference)
**Strategy**: Deferred quality assessment - optimize requirements and architecture together

This stage conducts comprehensive quality assessment across all dimensions, optimizing requirements and architecture holistically rather than in isolation.

## Task 4.1: Assess Specification Quality

**Status**: Not Started

**Description**: Conduct comprehensive quality assessment with scoring across all dimensions in organized project structure

**Required Deliverables**: 
- `generated/design/score-sheet-iteration-1.md` - Initial quality assessment
- `generated/design/specification-package-iteration-2/` - First improved package (if improvements needed)

**Methodology Reference**: Follow complete assessment framework in `core-methodology/design-review.md` including:
- Multi-dimensional evaluation (5 weighted categories: Requirements 25%, Architecture 25%, Security 20%, Implementation 15%, Business Value 15%)
- Detailed scoring methodology with evidence-based assessment requirements
- Holistic evaluation approach with cross-domain analysis
- Quality verification controls and hallucination prevention framework

### Key Activities

#### Initial Assessment
- **Customer Context Review**: Read `.workflow-state/customer-context.md` to understand project type (POC/MVP/Production) and adjust scoring expectations accordingly
- **Comprehensive Review**: Review complete specification package from requirements generation and architecture generation stage
- **Apply Methodology**: Use complete assessment framework from `core-methodology/design-review.md`
- **Issue Identification**: Identify critical issues and improvement opportunities
- **Priority Assessment**: Prioritize improvements by impact and effort

**Context-Aware Scoring Note**: A POC with basic monitoring and simple error handling may score 90/100 if appropriate for concept validation. A Production system requires comprehensive operational excellence for the same score.

**IMPORTANT**: If the customer explicitly requested specific requirements (e.g., comprehensive audit logging, advanced security monitoring), those MUST be included and scored regardless of project type. Only suggest simplification for requirements that were NOT explicitly requested by the customer. When in doubt, reference the requirements traceability matrix for source.

#### Score Sheet Generation
- **Follow OUTPUT 1 Requirements**: Generate standalone score sheet following exact format in `core-methodology/design-review.md`
- **Evidence-Based Scoring**: All assessments must reference specific specification content
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Provide category-by-category scoring with specific document references
- **Critical Issues**: Highlight critical issues requiring immediate attention
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Provide specific, actionable improvement recommendations

#### Initial Improvement Package (if needed)
- **Follow OUTPUT 2 Requirements**: Create improved package following exact format in `core-methodology/design-review.md`
- **Iteration 2 Creation**: Create improved package in iteration-2 folder if score < 90/100
- **File Management**: Modified files get "-improved" suffix, unchanged files copied from previous iteration
- **Cross-Domain Optimization**: Optimize requirements and architecture together

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Methodology Compliance**: Assessment follows complete framework in `core-methodology/design-review.md`
- **Organized Output**: Score sheet placed in project root folder with clear naming
- **Evidence-Based Scoring**: All scores reference specific specification content
- **Critical Issues Identified**: All critical issues identified with improvement roadmap
- **Initial Improvement**: If score < 90/100, iteration-2 package created with improvements



## Task 4.2: Improve Requirements and Architecture

**Status**: Not Started
**Dependencies**: Task 4.1

**Description**: Execute improvement cycles until 90/100 threshold achieved through holistic optimization in organized project structure

**Required Deliverables**: 
- `generated/design/score-sheet-iteration-X.md` - Score sheet for each iteration
- `generated/design/specification-package-iteration-X/` - Complete package for each iteration

**Methodology Reference**: Follow complete iterative improvement process in `core-methodology/design-review.md` including:
- Iterative review process with mandatory 90/100 continuation rule
- Folder structure requirements for each iteration
- Score progression tracking methodology
- File management rules (modified files get "-improved" suffix)

### Key Activities

#### Iteration Execution (Repeat until 90/100 achieved, max 5 iterations)
- **Apply Methodology**: Use complete iterative improvement framework from `core-methodology/design-review.md`
- **Issue Prioritization**: Prioritize improvements based on impact and feasibility
- **Cross-Domain Optimization**: Optimize requirements and architecture together
- **Progress Documentation**: Generate score sheet and complete package for each iteration

#### Iteration Management
- **Follow OUTPUT 1 & 2 Requirements**: Generate both standalone score sheet and improved package per methodology
- **Mandatory Continuation**: If score < 90/100, MUST continue iterating (max 5 iterations)
- **File Management**: Modified files get "-improved" suffix, unchanged files copied from previous iteration
- **Progress Tracking**: Document score progression using format in `core-methodology/design-review.md`

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Methodology Compliance**: Iterations follow complete process in `core-methodology/design-review.md`
- **Score Progression**: Clear progression toward 90/100 target score with documented evidence
- **Complete Iteration Packages**: Each iteration includes both score sheet and complete specification package
- **Issue Resolution**: Critical issues systematically addressed and resolved
- **Holistic Improvement**: Requirements and architecture improved together for optimal outcomes

## Task 4.3: Verify Quality Standards Met

**Status**: Not Started
**Dependencies**: Task 4.2

**Description**: Confirm implementation readiness and quality threshold achievement before security assessment

### Key Activities

#### Quality Threshold Validation
- **Score Verification**: Verify 90/100+ threshold achievement with documented evidence
- **Quality Consistency**: Ensure quality maintained across all categories per methodology
- **Critical Issues Resolution**: Confirm all critical issues resolved with specific evidence
- **Assessment Integrity**: Verify all scores are based on actual specification content, not assumptions

#### Implementation Readiness Assessment
- **Development Readiness**: Confirm specification ready for development team handoff
- **Architecture Feasibility**: Validate technical feasibility of final architecture
- **Requirements Clarity**: Ensure requirements provide clear implementation guidance
- **Integration Completeness**: Verify all components properly integrated

#### Documentation Completeness
