# OQR 2.0 Implementation Framework for Quality Delivery

## Overview

This steering document establishes the framework for delivering high-quality implementation plans based on AWS ProServe's Opportunity Quality Review (OQR 2.0) methodology. Use this guidance to ensure all project deliverables meet enterprise standards and proactively mitigate delivery risks.

## Quality Framework Categories

All implementation plans must address these seven core quality dimensions:

### 1. Technical Expertise (TE)
- **Cutting-edge Solutions**: Design solutions that meet evolving customer needs
- **Collaborative Approach**: Work with customers and partners to understand unique challenges
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Ensure all solutions deliver quantifiable customer business outcomes
- **Architecture Excellence**: Follow established patterns and best practices

### 2. Project Management (PM)
- **On-time, On-budget Delivery**: Adopt leading Day 1 Delivery approaches
- **Proactive Communication**: Emphasize stakeholder engagement and transparency
- **Risk Management**: Identify and mitigate risks early in the process
- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensure alignment with customer objectives

### 3. Ability to Deliver Results (ADR)
- **Exceptional Results**: Set ambitious but achievable goals
- **Expertise Leverage**: Apply deep technical knowledge effectively
- **Rigorous Management**: Implement robust delivery management practices
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from challenges and iterate

### 4. Communication (C)
- **Effective Collaboration**: Foster transparency and trust
- **Clear Messaging**: Communicate concisely and respectfully
- **Active Listening**: Seek feedback and respond thoughtfully
- **Relationship Building**: Build strong stakeholder relationships

### 5. Availability (A)
- **Right Resources**: Ensure appropriate skills and expertise
- **Right Timing**: Deploy resources when needed
- **Capacity Planning**: Plan for resource availability and scaling
- **Skill Alignment**: Match technical capabilities to project needs

### 6. Ability to Deliver Securely (ADS)
- **Data Protection**: Implement robust security measures
- **Industry Standards**: Adhere to security best practices
- **Risk Minimization**: Continuously improve security posture
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory and governance requirements

### 7. Customer Obsession (CO)
- **Customer Success Focus**: We are obsessed with our customers' success, anticipating their needs and exceeding their expectations
- **Deep Listening**: Listen deeply to customer feedback and incorporate insights into delivery approach
- **Proactive Value Creation**: Proactively identify opportunities to add value beyond stated requirements
- **Continuous Engagement**: Maintain ongoing dialogue to ensure alignment with evolving customer needs

## Risk Assessment Criteria

### High-Risk Patterns (Require Enhanced Review)

When any of these conditions are present, implement additional quality controls:

#### Financial Risk Indicators
- **Large Deal Size**: Total contract value > $5M USD
- **Large Fixed Price**: FFP contracts > $500K USD
- **Low Risk Premium**: FFP with risk premium < 15% of total value

#### Technical Risk Indicators
- **Production Access**: Any access to customer production environments
- **Regulated Data**: Handling PII, PHI, CUI, or other regulated information
- **AI/ML Services**: Custom-trained or customer-specific AI/ML implementations
- **Missing Security**: Security resources < 8% of total effort

#### Partnership Risk Indicators
- **Thin Prime**: Partner delivery > 50% of total hours
- **Partner Clarity**: Unclear partner responsibilities and deliverables
- **Multiple Partners**: More than one partner firm involved

#### Delivery Risk Indicators
- **Low Customer Experience**: Customer lacks cloud production experience
- **Incomplete Understanding**: Limited knowledge of customer environment
- **Missing Documentation**: Insufficient technical or business documentation
- **Unclear Requirements**: Ambiguous or conflicting requirements

## Implementation Requirements

### Mandatory Documentation
Every implementation plan must include:

1. **Customer Business Outcomes (CBOs)**
   - Clearly defined and measurable success criteria
   - Alignment with customer strategic objectives
   - Quantifiable business value propositions

2. **Technical Architecture**
   - Detailed system design and component specifications
   - Integration patterns and data flow diagrams
   - Security architecture and controls

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Comprehensive risk identification and analysis
   - Mitigation strategies for each identified risk
   - Contingency planning for high-impact scenarios

4. **Resource Planning**
   - Detailed staffing plan with skill requirements
   - Security resource allocation (minimum 8% of effort)
   - Partner resource management (if applicable)

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Comprehensive testing approach across all levels
   - User acceptance testing procedures
   - Operational readiness reviews (for production deployments)

### Quality Gates

#### Pre-Implementation Review
- [ ] All high-risk patterns identified and addressed
- [ ] Customer business outcomes documented and validated
- [ ] Technical architecture reviewed and approved
- [ ] Security controls designed and validated
- [ ] Resource allocation confirmed and committed

#### Implementation Checkpoints
- [ ] Regular progress reviews against quality framework
- [ ] Risk mitigation effectiveness monitoring
- [ ] Stakeholder communication and feedback loops
- [ ] Quality metrics tracking and reporting

#### Post-Implementation Validation
- [ ] Customer business outcomes achievement verification
- [ ] Technical deliverable quality assessment
- [ ] Security posture validation
- [ ] Lessons learned documentation and sharing

## Escalation Criteria

Escalate to senior leadership when:
- Multiple high-risk patterns are present simultaneously
- Customer requirements conflict with security or compliance standards
- Resource constraints impact quality delivery capability
- Technical feasibility concerns arise during planning
- Stakeholder alignment cannot be achieved

## Success Metrics

Track these key performance indicators:
- **Quality Score**: Overall implementation quality rating (target: 90/100)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Percentage of identified risks successfully mitigated
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Post-delivery customer feedback scores
- **Delivery Performance**: On-time, on-budget delivery rates
- **Security Incidents**: Number of preventable security issues (target: 0)

## Continuous Improvement

- Conduct regular retrospectives on implementation quality
- Share lessons learned across the organization
- Update framework based on field experience and feedback
- Maintain alignment with evolving industry standards and practices
